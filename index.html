Imagine there's no heaven

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Livin' for today


Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Livin' life in peace


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.



Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.





And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.





Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.





So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.





Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.

What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key


Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Ooh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends


What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
How does it feel by the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)


No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Ooh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
(Could it be anybody?)
I want somebody to love
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
(What do you see when you turn out the light?)
I can't tell you but I know it's mine


Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Ooh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends


Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love

I sit and waitDoes an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go When we're grey and old

'Cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold


So when I'm lying in my bed

Thoughts running through my head
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead


And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead


When I'm feeling weak

And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love


And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead
